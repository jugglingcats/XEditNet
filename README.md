XEditNet is a WYSIWYG XML editor written in .NET.

It consists of a core control, plus an "author" application which is intended to be customised.

XEditNet was written some years ago and is no longer actively developed, and never formally released, but has some interesting features, including:

- DTD support
- Stylesheet support
- Visual table support (incomplete)
- Extensibility and plugin mechanism (eg. website author module)
