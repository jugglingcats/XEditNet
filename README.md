XEditNet is a WYSIWYG XML editor written in .NET.

It consists of a core control, plus an "author" application which is intended to be customised.

XEditNet was written some years ago and is no longer actively developed, and never formally released, but has some interesting features, including:

- DTD support
- Stylesheet support
- Visual table support (incomplete)
- Extensibility and plugin mechanism (eg. website author module)

The latest work done was a switch from SandDock (paid control library) and DockPanel Suite (OSS). This is all in XEditNetAuthor
project and so a lot of the menus are not hooked up, etc. For a full list of shortcut keys, see XEditNetCtrl/keys.xml.
